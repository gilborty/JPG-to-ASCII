# JPG-to-ASCII
Converts a JPG to ASCII text art

Not complete. I got bored memorizing lines for a play and wanted to see how well this would work.

Gross code but kind of fun. I will come back to this.

##Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 with OpenCV 3.0

#Build steps
##Typical CMake build
1. `mkdir build`
2. `cd build`
3. `make`

#Running it
I provided you with a sample image to test it on :smirk:

1. `cd build`
2. `./JPG-to-ASCII ../resources/MontagueHeadshot.jpg`
